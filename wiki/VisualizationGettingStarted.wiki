== Getting the Visualization API Library for GWT ==

You can download the latest production releases of the libraries from the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/downloads/ project download page]. After you download the distribution, uncompress it.  Inside the folder you will find a .jar file named `gwt-visualization.jar`. 

You can either reference the `.jar` file from the folder that you uncompressed the project in, or copy it to another location, such as the location of your GWT distribution (containing `gwt-dev-`_<machine>_`.jar` and `gwt-user.jar` files).  In this example, we've chosen to copy the file to the path `/usr/local/gwt-visualization`.
