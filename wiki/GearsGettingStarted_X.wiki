#summary Using Gears in a GWT project

= Getting Started with Gears =

This guide describes the basics behind writing a small project that uses the Gears API with [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit Google Web Toolkit] (GWT).  Before working through this guide, you should be somewhat familiar with the [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/ Gears developer's site].

== Assumptions ==
 
  * You are already familiar with [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/overview.html Google Web Toolkit]
  * You know how to [http://code.google.com/eclipse/docs/creating_new_webapp.html create a new GWT project] using the Google Plugin for Eclipse.

== Getting the Gears API Library for GWT ==

You can download the latest production releases of the libraries from the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/downloads/ project download page]. After you download the distribution, uncompress it.  Inside the folder you will find a .jar file named `gwt-gears.jar`. 

You can either reference the `.jar` file from the folder that you uncompressed the project in, or copy it to another location, such as the location of your GWT distribution (containing `gwt-dev.jar` and `gwt-user.jar` files).  In this example, we've chosen to copy the file to the path `/usr/local/gwt-gears`.

== Gears Modules and Topics ==
Gears contains three main modules, [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_localserver.html LocalServer], [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html Database], and [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_workerpool.html WorkerPool].

Continue to [GearsGettingStartedDatabase Database] to learn how to use the Gears Database Module.
Continue to [GearsGettingStartedOffline LocalServer] to learn how to use the Gears LocalServer Module.
Continue to [GearsGettingStartedWorkerPool WorkerPool] to learn how to use the Gears WorkerPool Module.
