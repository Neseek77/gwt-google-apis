= Gears API Library for GWT Release Notes =

==Release Notes for 1.1.0==
===Changes since r290===

    * This library requires GWT 1.5 or later and Java 1.5 or later.
    * Refactored API to use GWT 1.5's new JavaScript overlay feature; you must use the Factory class to get Gears class instances.
    * Renamed packages under a common client root.
    * All samples will now rebind their EntryPoints to handle cases where Gears is not installed.

===Known Issues===

    * Gears applications can only be debugged using GWT's hosted mode on Windows; none of the other hosted mode platforms support the Gears plugin. (issue 11)
    * Creating a Worker from a GWT module is not supported out-of-the-box.
