#summary Using Gears in a project

= Getting Started with Gears =

This guide describes the basics behind writing a small project that uses the Gears API with [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit Google Web Toolkit] (GWT).  Before working through this guide, you should be somewhat familiar with the [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/ Gears developer's site].

== Assumptions ==
 
This guide assumes you are already familiar with using Google Web Toolkit. See the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/overview.html GWT Documentation] to learn how to create a new GWT project.  Make sure you are familiar with the  `applicationCreator` tool to help create new projects and to integrate your project with the Eclipse IDE.  

== Getting the Google API Libraries for GWT `gwt-gears` library ==

You can download the latest production releases of the libraries from the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/downloads/ project download page]. After you download the distribution, uncompress it.  Inside the folder you will find a .jar file named `gwt-gears.jar`. 

You can either reference the `.jar` file from the folder that you uncompressed the project in, or copy it to another location, such as the location of your GWT distribution (containing `gwt-dev-`_<machine>_`.jar` and `gwt-user.jar` files).  In this example, we've chosen to copy the file to the path `/usr/local/gwt-gears`.


== Gears Modules and Topics ==
Gears contains three main modules, [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_localserver.html LocalServer], [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html Database], and [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_workerpool.html WorkerPool]. In this guide, we will describe how to use the Database module only, though support exists for LocalServer and WorkerPool as well.
