#summary Support for iGoogle Gadgets / OpenSocial Apps / Google Mapplets
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

iGoogle Gadgets, Mapplets, and !OpenSocial apps (collectively referred to as Gadgets) are essentially regular web applications with an additional manifest file designed to run in a container environment.  The goal of the GWT4Gadgets sub-project is to make GWT the easiest way to create and deploy Gadgets.

= Goals =

  * Automatic generation of the Gadget manifest file
  * Produce a bootstrap sequence more optimal than you would choose to implement by hand
  * Provide extensible access to emerging or container-specific APIs (e.g. !OpenSocial)
  * Maximize Gadget performance and minimize impact on the developer's hosts by taking advantage of available caching mechanisms.

= Non-goals =
  * Make Gadget development exactly like regular GWT development.
    * Specific restrictions, limitations, or alterations to the status quo may be introduced if it makes the 80% case better.
