== How do I write worker thread code in GWT ==

The bindings do not support such a way right now, but if you create a GWT module and specify the Single Script linker, you can load the generated script as a public resource using the [http://gwt-google-apis.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.1/gears/com/google/gwt/gears/client/workerpool/WorkerPool.html#createWorkerFromUrl(java.lang.String) WorkerPool.createWorkerFromUrl(String)] method.
