  * Allow GWT bindings to be developed and released independently.
  * Make the process of developing GWT bindings easier.

= Directory Layout for API source =
  * distro-source
  * doc
  * eclipse
  * [gwt bindings source code]
  * samples

= Directory Layout for API distribution = 
  * COPYING
  * COPYING.html

  * checkstyle
  * clean
  * doc
  * samples
  * test
    * test.hosted

= Issue Tracking =
  * Issues should be labeled with an API specific label - maps for JS maps, gears for gears, etc.

= Open Issues =
  * Make sure that APIs that depend on different versions of JSIO can play nicely with each other.
  * Provide a devdocreader documentation template?
  * Provide template build scripts for new APIs
