#summary GWT compiler cannot resolve import

= GWT compiler cannot resolve import =

You may have successfully compiled the project class files in an IDE, but when invoking the GWT compiler for the first time on a new project using one of the APIs provided with the GWT Google API, you may come across an error similar to the following:

{{{
$ ./gearsTest-compile
Analyzing source in module 'com.example.gearsTest'
   [ERROR] Errors in '/Users/zundel/Documents/workspace2/galgwt-issue3/src/com/example/client/gearsTest.java'
      [ERROR] Line 9:  The import com.google.gwt.gears cannot be resolved
      [ERROR] Line 26:  Gears cannot be resolved
}}}

The problem you are encountering is that there is no module that provides the package `com.google.gwt.gears` on the module source path.  This can be resolved in one of two ways:

 1 Add a `<source>` tag to your _<module>_`.gwt.xml` file that defines the package path.
 1 Add an `<inherits>` tag if your Third party library provides one.   For using the
Gears package in GWT Google API, the appropriate line is:

{{{
   <inherits name='com.google.gwt.gears.Gears'>
}}}
