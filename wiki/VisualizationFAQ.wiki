#summary GWT Visualization questions that are asked frequently.  Very frequently.

= Visualization FAQs = 


== Where can I go to get help with using the Visualization APIs? ==

For general questions about the Visualization API for GWT, first try the 
[http://groups.google.com/group/google-visualization-api Google Visualization API] Google group.  Make sure to mention that you are using the GWT wrappers for the project.

Another place you can to for help is the [http://groups.google.com/group/gwt-google-apis GWT-Google-Apis] group, which is the forum for the developers of the GWT wrappers for all Google APIs.  You can also try the [http://groups.google.com/group/gwt-google-api Google-Web-Toolkit] group which is the main public forum for GWT. 
  
== What should I do if I think I've found a bug? ==

First post your bug to the [http://groups.google.com/group/gwt-google-api GWT-Google-Apis] group for discussion.  There may be a workaround or a patch already in place for the problem.  Bugs are logged in the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/issues/list Issue Tracker].  Please reserve the issue tracker for bugs with the API itself, and not for diagnosing problems with a particular application.

== Why do I see the dialog "Password needed" when extracting the .zip distribution in Windows? ==

There are some files created by the GWT compiler that are very long and cause issues with the built-in Windows compressed folder support.  You can try using a different program to unzip the folder (such as Cygwin or 7-zip), or you can use the `.tar.gz` distribution.

== Why can't I run the samples from the distribution? ==

If you are on Windows, you may be hitting a path length problem.  Try unpacking the distribution in a folder with a short name off of the root of a drive.

If you are having trouble running the sample scripts XXX-shell.com and XXX-compile.cmd,  make sure you have the GWT_HOME environment variable set.  It should contain a pathname that contains a uncompressed GWT distribution.

== Why do I get an exception saying that $wnd.google.visualization is null? ==

The following stack trace indicates that the Visualization JavaScript API is not getting loaded:

{{{
[ERROR] Unable to load module entry point class
com.example.myviz.client.MyViz (see associated exception for
details)
com.google.gwt.core.client.JavaScriptException: (TypeError):
'$wnd.google.visualization' is null or not an object
 number: -2146823281
 description: '$wnd.google.visualization' is null or not an object
        at com.google.gwt.visualization.client.visualizations.Table.createJso
(Native Method) 
...
}}}

Make sure your hosted HTML page includes a `<script>` tag to load the Ajax Loader.  

{{{
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
}}}

You can then add !JavaScript code to load the visualizations yourself, or you can use the !AjaxLoader class provided with the gwt-visualization API.  See the [VisualizationGettingStarted Getting Started] page for an example.

== I removed a !VisualizationWidget from a Panel.  When I added it back, it was gone!  What happened? ==

GWT developers are used to working with widgets while they are detached from the DOM.  Attaching and detaching the widgets affects how and where they appear, but not the widgets themselves.  However, many of the visualizations provided by the Google Visualization API do not support this pattern.  (Currently, this applies to the !AreaChart, !BarChart, !ColumnChart, !LineChart, !PieChart, and !ScatterChart.)  Thus, these visualizations should be added to a panel once and not removed until they are no longer needed.

== I called `setSelection()` on a visualization before adding it to a Panel.  Why didn't it work? ==

Some methods of some visualizations only work properly when the visualization is attached to the DOM.  See the answer to the previous question.
