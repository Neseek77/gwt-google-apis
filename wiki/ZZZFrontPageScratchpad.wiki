=Google API Libraries for Google Web Toolkit=

The Google API Libraries for Google Web Toolkit is a collection of libraries that provide Java language bindings for popular Google !JavaScript APIs. These libraries make it quick and easy for developers to use these Google !JavaScript APIs with Google Web Toolkit. The libraries are supported by the Google Web Toolkit team.

==Available Libraries===

Note that these versions rely on [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html GWT 1.5.3] or higher.

====[http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=gwt-google-apis&s=gwt-google-apis&t=GearsGettingStarted Gears 1.1 Library]====
  Version 1.1 of the Gears library is now available. In addition to support for the Gears !LocalServer, Database, and !WorkerPool, this version adds integrated support for offline applications and updated sample applications.  The bindings have also been refactored to use 
!JavaScript overlays, and a new package hierarchy.

====[http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=gwt-google-apis&s=gwt-google-apis&t=GadgetsGettingStarted Gadgets 1.0 Library]====
  [http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/ Gadgets] are simple HTML and !JavaScript applications that can be embedded in webpages and other apps. This library simplifies gadget development with GWT by automatically generating a [http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/legacy/reference.html#XML_Ref Gadget Specification] from Java source, inserting a selection script in the specification much like a regular GWT project. After compiling your gadget with GWT, all files are in place to [http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/legacy/publish.html publish] your gadget. 

====[http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=gwt-google-apis&s=gwt-google-apis&t=AJAXSearchGettingStarted Google AJAX Search 1.0 Library]====
  The [http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/ Google AJAX Search API] lets you put Google Search in your web pages, including Web, Local, and Multimedia searches. This library allows you to access that API from Java code compiled with the GWT compiler. 

====[http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=gwt-google-apis&s=gwt-google-apis&t=MapsGettingStarted Google Maps 1.0 Library]====
  The [http://code.google.com/apis/maps/ Google Maps API] library provides a way to access the Google Maps API from a GWT project without having to write additional !JavaScript code.  The library gives you full control using the standard Maps components such as !InfoWindows, Markers, !MapTypes, and Geocoding.  You can even use advanced features such as adding GWT widgets to the Map, creating custom overlays, custom map types, and other components.

====[http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=gwt-google-apis&s=gwt-google-apis&t=Visualization Google Visualization 1.0 Library]====
  The [http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/ Google Visualization API] library enables you to expose your own data, stored on any data-store that is connected to the web, as a Visualization compliant datasource.  Some of the visualizations supported by this release candidate library include the [http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/piechart.html Google Piechart], [http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/annotatedtimeline.html Google Annotated Timeline] and [http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/geomap.html Google GeoMap]. For a full list of visualizations with GWT wrappers you can refer to the [http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery.html Google Visualization Gallery]. 

==Release Candidates==
Release Candidates for the following libraries are now available and ready to be taken for a test drive. Note that these versions rely on [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html GWT 1.5.3] or higher.

====[http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=gwt-google-apis&s=gwt-google-apis&t=GearsGettingStarted Gears 1.2 Library]====
  Version 1.2 of the Gears API library for GWT adds support for Gelocation and Blob support which are new in Gears 0.4.  

==Under Development==
Please see the [Downloads download page] for milestone builds of other libraries.
