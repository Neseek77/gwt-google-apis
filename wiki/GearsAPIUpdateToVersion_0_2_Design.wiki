#summary Design: Gears API Update to version 0.2

= Goals =
  * Expose the new features of the Gears API version 0.2 in a GWT friendly way.

= Non-goals =
  * TBD

= Changes Gears API version 0.2 = 
  # New HttpRequest Module API
  # New Timer Module API
  # Update WorkerPool API
  # Update LocalServer API
  # Update Factory API

= Proposed Use Cases =
  # Create a worker thread from a GWT module's {GWT Module}.nocache.js file.
  # Allow HttpRequest Module API to be used from a worker thread.
  # Allow the Timer Module API to be used from a worker thread.
  
= Open Issues = 
  # Will WorkerPool.createWorkerFromUrl allow a worker thread to be created from the {GWT Module}.nocache.js file?
  # Can we use a GWT rebind rule to select the Gears HttpRequest Module API when GWT's RequestBuilder is used from within a worker thread module?
  # Can we use a GWT rebind rule to select the Gears Timer Module API when GWT's Timer class is used from a worker thread?
