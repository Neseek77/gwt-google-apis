#summary Design: Gears API Update to version 0.2

= Goals =
  * Expose the new features of the Gears API version 0.2 in a GWT friendly way.

= Non-goals =
  * TBD

= Changes Gears API version 0.2 = 
  # New HttpRequest Module API
    * This only makes sense for workers.  Most likely we would make GWT's RequestBuilder use the Gears XmlHttpRequest object.
  # New Timer Module API
    * This only makes sense for workers.  Most likely we would make GWT's Timer class rebind to use the Gears internal timer.
  # Update WorkerPool API
    * Add onerror callback - this can only be set from the worker; does not impact the parent thread
    * Add createWorkerFromURL - 
    * Add allowCrossOrigin - this can only be called from the worker
    * Update onmessage callback to use the messageObject parameter
  # Update LocalServer API
  # Expose the Factory version property

= Proposed Use Cases =
  # Declare a worker thread.
  # Create a worker thread from a URL.
  # Allow HttpRequest Module API to be used from a worker thread.
  # Allow the Timer Module API to be used from a worker thread.
  
= Open Issues = 
  # Will WorkerPool.createWorkerFromUrl allow a worker thread to be created from the {GWT Module}.nocache.js file?
  # Can we use a GWT rebind rule to select the Gears HttpRequest Module API when GWT's RequestBuilder is used from within a worker thread module?
  # Can we use a GWT rebind rule to select the Gears Timer Module API when GWT's Timer class is used from a worker thread?
