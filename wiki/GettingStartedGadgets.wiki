#summary How to write and debug a Google Gadget using GWT

= Introduction =

This section will get you started writing your first Google Gadget.  But before you start, make sure you are familiar with [http://www.google.com/ig iGoogle] and [http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/ the Gadgets developer site].

== Looking at a Sample Gadget ==

  *TBD*

  Look at Hello Gadgets: [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/source/browse/trunk/gadgets/samples/hellogadgets/src/com/google/gwt/gadgets/sample/hellogadgets/client/HelloGadgets.java HelloGadgets.java]

== Writing a Gadget ==

  *TBD: (FROM JAVADOC)*

   1. Declare a subtype of Gadget (e.g. public class MyGadget extends Gadget) that is default instantiable.
   2. If the Gadget requires access to features of the container, it should implement any of the NeedsFoo interfaces.
   3. At runtime, all feature setters will be called strictly before init(UserPreferences). The order in which the setters are called is undefined.

Access to user preferences is provided through a user-defined subtype of the UserPreferences interface. Each preference should be defined as a zero-argument method, returning the desired type of UserPreferences.Preference. The Gadget type should be parameterized with the specific UserPreferences subtype, which will be provided to the init(UserPreferences) method. 

== Registering your Gadget ==

  *TBD*

  (Most of this is covered by [http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/ the Gadgets developer site].)

== Debugging your Gadget in Hosted Mode ==
