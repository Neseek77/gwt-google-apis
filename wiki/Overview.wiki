#summary Overview of the GWT Google APIs project

= Overview =

Using Google APIs you can integrate some of Google's online services such as 
[http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/ Google AJAX Search API], 
[http://code.google.com/apis/maps/ Google Maps API],
[http://code.google.com/apis/gears/ Google Gears API],  and 
[http://code.google.com/apis/base/ Google Base Data API] into third party websites.  These APIs were originally offered as !JavaScript APIs for web programmers.  

The [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ Google Web Toolkit] (GWT) brings a new dimension to web programming by offering a way to write a web application in the Java langauge, and deploy it to the web using !JavaScript.  

The GWT Google APIs eases integrating existing Google APIs and browser extensions with an application written using GWT.   The API is a set of Java bindings, giving GWT developers easy access to the latest capabilities of Google APIs without having to resort to writing custom integration code using !JavaScript.
