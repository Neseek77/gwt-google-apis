#summary Overview of the Google API Libraries for Google Web Toolkit

[http://code.google.com/apis/gears/ Gears API],  and 
[http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/ Gadgets]. These libraries make it quick and easy for you to use these !JavaScript APIs in your Google Web Toolkit project without having to write custom integration code using !JavaScript.
