#summary Overview of the Google API Libraries for Google Web Toolkit

= Overview =

Using the Google API Libraries you can easily use Google's existing !JavaScript APIs such as the
[http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/ Google AJAX Search API], 
[http://code.google.com/apis/gears/ Gears API],  and 
[http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/ Gadgets] in your Google Web Toolkit projects.  

The [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ Google Web Toolkit] (GWT) brings a new dimension to web programming by offering a way to write an AJAX web application in the Java language, and deploy it to the web using !JavaScript.  

The Google API Libraries for GWT eases integrating existing Google APIs and browser extensions with an application written using GWT.   The libraries provide a set of Java bindings, giving GWT developers easy access to the latest capabilities of Google APIs without having to write custom integration code using !JavaScript.
