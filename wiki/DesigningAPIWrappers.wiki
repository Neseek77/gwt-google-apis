#summary A list of tips and lessons learned for creating JavaScript API wrappers for GWT

= Designing JavaScript API Wrappers for GWT =

When creating a wrapper for an existing JavaScript API using the Google Web Toolkit, there are a number of approaches available.  This page will point out some common approaches and some lessons learned over the course of creating wrappers for several APIs.

== Tools for integrating JavaScript with GWT ==

  * !JavaScript Native Interface (JSNI) (_TBD_ link to GWT Dev Guide)
  * !JavaScript overlays (_TBD_ link to GWT Dev Guide)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-api-interop JavaScript InterOp library (JSIO)]
  * GWT Linker extensions (_TBD_ link to GWT Dev Guide)
  * GWT Generators (_TBD_ link to GWT Dev Guide)
  * Script Injection (_TBD_ link to GWT Dev Guide)

== Common Coding Issues ==

  * Getting and setting JavaScript Property values
  * Passing Arrays back and forth between JavaScript library
  * Exposing Constant values
  * Creating a class intended for end developers to subclass and override implementation.
  * Creating a Java class hierarchy out of a JavaScript class hierarchy.
  * Passing a callback function to a !JavaScript method.

== Common Design Problems ==

  * Deciding when to omit a feature.
  * Deciding when to create extra types.
  * Planning your wrappers for future JS API growth.
  * Providing access to !JavaScriptObject instances for end developer flexibility.
