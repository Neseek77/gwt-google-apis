==Release Notes for 1.2.0==
===Changes since 1.1.1==

   * Adds Gears 0.4 feature support:
      * Geolocation<
      * Desktop
      * Blob
      * HttpRequest
      * File Upload demo
   * Added support for Factory.getPermission() and Factory.hasPermission()
   * Updated all samples to allow more heap memory in launch scripts.

===Known Issues in 1.1.1===

    * Gears applications can only be debugged using GWT's hosted mode on Windows; none of the other hosted mode platforms support the Gears plugin. (issue 11)
    * Creating a Worker from a GWT module is not supported out-of-the-box.
    * GWT hosted mode does not respect URLs which are being redirected by the Gears plugin version 0.4.X. As a result, the ManagedResourceDemo will not demonstrate the expected refresh behavior.

==Release Notes for 1.1.0 (release candidate)==
===Changes since r290===
