A guide for how to create GWT bindings for JS APIs.

See [??? Making GWT Better] to get started.

* Directory structure conventions
* package structure
* Build requirements (ant, GWT_TOOLS)
   * Required ant targets
   * Unit tests for wrapped functionality
   * samples
* Design Goals:
   * Take JS constructs & make them easy to use for Java developers (type safe-ness)
   * Javadoc should stand on its own
   * Small/Easy to use
   * Optimizable in terms of resulting code size.  Wrappers should not incur a large runtime cost.
* [DesigningAPIWrappers Binding design guidelines]
* Loading Patterns
   * Put it in API provided module.gwt.xml
   * Put it in user's .gwt.xml
   * (need ajaxloader sol'n)
