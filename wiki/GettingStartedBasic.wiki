#summary Adding Google APIs to a GWT Project using the gwt-google-apis .jar files.

= Introduction  =

This guide assumes you are already familiar with using the Google Web Toolkit.  See the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/overview.html GWT Documentation] to learn how to create a new GWT project.  Make sure you are familiar with the  `applicationCreator` tool to help create new projects and to integrate your project with the Eclipse IDE.  

= Using a library or source code =

When you develop code with the GWT Google APIs you have two choices.  You can either use the library from a JAR file, or you can use the library by pointing to a source tree, usually a current version of the library checked out from the Subversion repository.  Which method you choose depends on your development needs.

The production version of the GWT Google APIs is distributed as a
`.jar` file that is easy to integrate with an existing GWT project.
Choose the `.jar` file library if you need a stable release of the
library and do not care to get the latest features.

The latest version of the API source code is also publicly available
from a [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] repository hosted by
[http://code.google.com/ Google Code].  Choose the source code if you
need to use the latest features and bug fixes by the library, or if
you are interested in contributing patches to the library.  See the instructions for  [GettingStartedSource getting started using the gwt-google-apis source code]  if you wish to go this route.


== Adding Google APIs to a GWT Project as a library ==

This section describes how to integrate one of the `gwt-google-apis` JAR files library
with an existing GWT project.  In this case, we are going to use the `gwt-maps.jar` library as an example.

=== Getting the GWT Google APIs gwt-maps library ===

You can download the latest production release of the GWT Google APIs library from the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/downloads/list project download page].  Choose the _All Downloads_ option to see 
After you download the distribution, uncompress
it.  Inside the folder you will find a file named
`gwt-google-apis.jar`. This is the one file you need to integrate the
APIs with your project. 

You can either reference the `.jar` file from the folder that you
uncompressed the project in, or copy it to another location, such as
the location of your GWT distribution (containing
`gwt-dev-`_<machine>_`.jar` and `gwt-user.jar` files).  Whichever
place you choose, this documentation will refer to this path as
_GWT_GOOGLE_APIS_DIR_.

=== Creating your project ===

If you have not yet created a GWT project, create one now.  You can
use the `applicationCreator` tool, or an IDE plugin, or create a
project manually.  Essentially, you need to then add the path
_GWT_GOOGLE_APIS_DIR_`/gwt-maps.jar` to the Java classpath.


=== Updating <project>-compile and <project>-shell ===

First, create a project with `projectCreator` and `applicationCreator` as shown in the GWT Getting Started tutorial and Developer Guide.  In the following example, the GWT Google API jar file `gwt-maps.jar` has been unpacked in `/usr/local/gwt-maps`

{{{
$PP_OFF
$ projectCreator -eclipse MapsTutorial -out MapsTutorial \
     -addToClassPath /usr/local/gwt-maps/gwt-maps.jar 
Created directory MapsTutorial/src
Created directory MapsTutorial/test
Created file MapsTutorial/.project
Created file MapsTutorial/.classpath

$ applicationCreator -eclipse MapsTutorial -out MapsTutorial \
     -addToClassPath /usr/local/gwt-maps/gwt-maps.jar \
     -inheritModule com.google.gwt.maps.GoogleMaps \
     com.example.google.gwt.mapstutorial.client.MapsTutorial 
Created directory MapsTutorial/src/com/example/google/gwt/mapstutorial
Created directory MapsTutorial/src/com/example/google/gwt/mapstutorial/client
Created directory MapsTutorial/src/com/example/google/gwt/mapstutorial/public
Created file MapsTutorial/src/com/example/google/gwt/mapstutorial/MapsTutorial.gwt.xml
Created file MapsTutorial/src/com/example/google/gwt/mapstutorial/public/MapsTutorial.html
Created file MapsTutorial/src/com/example/google/gwt/mapstutorial/client/MapsTutorial.java
Created file MapsTutorial/MapsTutorial-shell
Created file MapsTutorial/MapsTutorial-compile
}}}

This command sets up a standard project, plus adds the library `/usr/local/gwt-maps/gwt-maps.jar` to the Java classpath for the launch, compile and .and eclipse definitions.


Test to see that hosted mode and web mode work by running the `MapsTutorial-shell` script.  You should see the skeleton project come up:

Also try out the `MapsTutorial-compile` script:

{{{
$PP_OFF
$ ./MapsTutorial-compile
Compiling into ./www/com.example.google.gwt.mapstutorial.MapsTutorial
Copying all files found on public path
Compilation succeeded
}}}


  http://gwt-google-apis.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/GettingStartedBasic3.png

Now, replace the contents of your `onModuleLoad()` method in `MapTutorial.java` with some sample maps code.

{{{    
    // Open a map centered on Cawker City, KS USA
    map = new MapWidget(new LatLng(39.509,-98.434), 2);
    map.setSize("500px", "300px");
    
    // Add some controls for the zoom level
    map.addControl(new LargeMapControl());
    
    // Add an info window to highlight a point of interest
    map.getInfoWindow().open(map.getCenter(), 
        new InfoWindowContent("World's Largest Ball of Twine"));
    
    // Add the map to the HTML host page
    RootPanel.get("mapsTutorial").add(map);
  }
}
}}}


=== Run the !MapsTutorial sample project ===

Now, you should be able to execute your sample project in hosted mode by  launch the skeleton project in hosted mode by either running _!MapsTutorial-shell_ from the command line or using the _Run_ configuration from Eclipse.

If you would like to see your project in your host's web browser (web mode), press the _Compile/Browse_ button in hosted mode.
