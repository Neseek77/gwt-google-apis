     <h2>Release Notes for @GWT_VERSION@</h2>
       <h3>Changes since r290</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>This library requires GWT 1.5 or later and Java 1.5 or later.</li>
         <li>This library requires the use of the Google Maps API 2.113 or later.</li>
         <li>Removed Listener classes for events that were previously deprecated.  Each removed class has an equivalent Handler class.</li>
         <li>Changed many classes to be subclasses of JavaScriptObject (JavaScript overlay types).  This means that you can no longer use <code>new</code> to construct many types - you must use the factory method <code>Type.newInstance()</code> instead.</li>
         <li>Fixed problems initializing constants on IE6/7 in Hosted Mode.</li>
         <li>Removed MarkerManager, as Maps team is discontinuing support for it in deference to an open source version with more features.</li>
         <li>Added checks to see that the JS API was properly loaded.</li>
         <li>Added support for Polyline and Polygon drawing/editing features.</li>
         <li>Updates to JSIO to support pre-release changes to GWT 1.5 hosted mode.</li>
         <li>Added support for the Google Earth map type and retrieving the plugin instance</li>
         <li>Fixed GeocodeCache subclassing issues.</li>
         <li>Added many unit tests.</li>
         <li>Fixed many other issues noted in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/issues/list?can=1&q=API%3AMaps+Milestone%3A1_1_RC">Issue Tracker</a>.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Known Issues</h3>
	   <ul>
             <li>Not all features in the Maps API are supported.  The Maps API is constantly evolving.</li>
	   </ul>
       <hr/>
      <a name="Release_Notes_r290"></a>
     <h2>Release Notes for r290 (milestone release)</h2>
       <h3>Changes since r41</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Added many Maps API features added since 2.83 up to 2.98.</li>
         <li>Updated features now require Java 1.5 and GWT 1.5 or higher.</li>
         <li>Updated to use Java 1.5 generics, enum types, and annotations.</li>
         <li>Maps project placed in a separate tree so it can be built and distributed independently.</li>
         <li>New event handling system that models each Maps API with a single Java Event and Handler class.  Existing Listener classes are now deprecated.</li>
         <li>Added unit tests for event handing.</li>
         <li>Added javadoc comments to all classes.</li>
         <li>Updated to use JSIO r83.</li>
         <li>Removed use of long values passed via JSNI and JSIO methods.</li>
         <li>Added styling and documentation to the HelloMaps sample project.</li>
         <li>Added additional features to the HelloMaps sample project, partially as a way to manually test the newly added API features.</li>
         <li>Changed API to extract constant values from the Maps API instead of hard coding constants in Java.</li>
         <li>Many issues from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/issues/list">issue tracker</a> have been addressed, all marked as version 1.1_RC.</li>
       </ul>
