      If you want to deploy this application outside of localhost,  you 
      may want to obtain an API key at:
      
        http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/signup.html
      
      You do not need a key to use this API. Using a key in your application/site 
      is completely optional. However, it is useful to have one for notification
      about problems with your site from Google.
     
      After you obtain a valid key, append "&amp;key=ABC" to the string below,
      where "ABC" is the key you are given.  Note that the beginning of the 
      URL may be different from the one presented on the signup page.  (We
      recommend you keep this one.)
